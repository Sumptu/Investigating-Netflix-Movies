# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This project on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix movie data from the 1990s has significantly enhanced my data science portfolio by demonstrating my ability to:
  1. Clean and Preprocess Data: I worked with data in datacampt courses, handling missing values, filtering relevant datasets, and ensuring data integrity for      
     accurate analysis.
  2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I utilized Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to explore trends, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights      from the dataset.
  3. Visualize Data Effectively: By creating visualizations such as histograms using Matplotlib, I showcased my ability to present data in a clear and impactful way,      making complex information accessible.
  4. Apply Logical Filtering and Aggregation: I implemented advanced filtering techniques using np.logical_and and aggregation methods to answer specific business         questions, such as identifying the most frequent movie duration and counting short action movies.
  5. Solve Real-World Problems: This project mirrors real-world scenarios where data scientists are tasked with analyzing data to derive actionable insights, such as      understanding trends in movie production and audience preferences.
  6. Showcase Technical Skills: The project highlights my proficiency in Python, data manipulation, and statistical analysis, which are critical skills for any data       scientist.
  7. Build a Foundation for Advanced Analysis: This EDA project serves as a stepping stone for more advanced analyses, such as predictive modeling or recommendation 
     systems, which I plan to explore in future projects.

By including this project in my portfolio, I demonstrate my ability to tackle data-driven challenges, communicate insights effectively, and apply technical skills to solve real-world problemsâ€”
